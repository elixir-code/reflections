When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repository is not a pre-requisite for solo projects. However, when multiple
collaborators collectively contribute to a project (like in most real world 
scenarios), remote repositories become a neccessity.

Even for single developer projects, remote repositories are good backups that come
handy if the local machine crashes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Git's auto pull can cause confusions as the local git repository gets flooded with changes
that have crept in from the remote repository without the user's consent.

It can also cause loss of the recent changes in working directory or raise conflict flags
if another user accidently changes the same segment of code that the  local  user changed
and pushed those changes to github. This can be irritating.
