When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repository is not a pre-requisite for solo projects. However, when multiple
collaborators collectively contribute to a project (like in most real world 
scenarios), remote repositories become a neccessity.

Even for single developer projects, remote repositories are good backups that come
handy if the local machine crashes.
